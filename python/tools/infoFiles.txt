Clones: contains rigid particles, 
1st line: # of particles
2nd line: x y z and quaternions
(radius of the body is determined by the radius in body_forces)

fibers: contains MTs, fibers
1st line: # of fibers
Npoints Bending module length 
coordinates 
(coordinates are ordered in such a way that the first point is 
where the fiber is attached to a body)

this repeats for every fiber

links: anchor points on PNC
# of anchor points = # of fibers
first 2 columns have no meaning, then x y z location of points,
then orientation of fibers (mostly, the normal direction)
(link coordinates assume that the body is at the origin)

force generator: # of molecular motors 
their positions, these attach fibers to PNC (?)

vertex: incomplete for points on rigid particle to solve for fluid problem
